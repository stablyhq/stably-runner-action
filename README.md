## Example Usage

```yaml
name: Stably Test Runner Example

# Define when you want the action to run
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
# You need to set these permissions if using the `github-comment` option
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  contents: write
jobs:
  stably-test-action:
    name: Stably Test Runner
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Stably Runner Action
        id: stably-runner
        uses: stablyhq/stably-runner-action@v3
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
          test-suite-id: TEST_SUITE_ID
          # setting variable overrides is optional
          variable-overrides: |
            {
              "APP_URL": "https://example.com",
            }

      - name: Print Output
        id: output
        run: echo "${{ steps.test-action.outputs.success }}"
```

## Testing containerized/localized applications

You can use the `variable-overrides` option to enable containrized/local testing by
replacing the original URL with a localhost URL.

Considering we have an existing test suite that we run in production with tests using an envrionment variables `APP_URL`, you can test your local application running in your CI at `http://localhost:3000` using this configuration:

```yaml
- name: Stably Runner Action
   id: stably-runner
   uses: stablyhq/stably-runner-action@v3
   with:
      api-key: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
      test-suite-id: TEST_SUITE_ID
      variable-overrides: |
        {
          "APP_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
        }

```

## Permissions

This action requires write permission to leave PR or commit comments.

You'll want to have the follow permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  contents: write
```

You can declare these at the top of your workflow.

Alternativly, you can modify all workflow permissions by going to
`Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions` and enabling read and
write permissions.

Note: For organizations, you'll have to first set this set/allow these
permissions at the organization level

   ```

5. Merge the pull request into the `master` branch

6. Release

   1. Draft a release via the GitHub UI and ensure you select to also publish to
